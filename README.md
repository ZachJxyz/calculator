# ZI-83 Calculator Clone

Yup, another calculator project to showcase my skills but this one's gonna be super lit because I'm cloning the ol' reliable calculator that got me through all of my Calculus classes: Texas Instrument's TI-83 Calculator

Thie gensis of this project began while going through The Odin Project's Full Stack curriculum.

The task was to create a basic calculator with basic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)

However, immediately, I thought to myself, *How cool would it be to have a TI-83 calculator instead??*

So.. that's what I decided to do lol
