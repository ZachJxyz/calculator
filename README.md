# ZJ-97 Calculator

### Yup, another calculator project to showcase my skills but this one's gonna be super lit because I'm cloning the ol' reliable calculator that got me through all of my Calculus classes: Texas Instrument's TI-83 Calculator

Thie gensis of this project began while going through The Odin Project's Full Stack curriculum.

The task was to create a basic calculator with basic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)

However, immediately, I thought to myself, "*How cool would it be to have a TI-83 calculator instead??*"

So.. that's what I decided to do lol

### Why'd I name it the **ZJ-97**?

Mostly because I want to avoid any potential copyright infringement even though this is for fun and irdk any legal stuff. ZJ97 are my initials and birth year so yeah.
